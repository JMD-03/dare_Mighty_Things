# { } Dare Mighty Things Hackathon 2019

Thanks for competing in the JLL Dare Mighty Things "Challenge"!

For this year's event, JLL is looking for students to think outside the box and find creative and innovative ways to leverage Machine Learning / AI to create human readable commercial real estate narratives.

This might sound like an easy task at first glance, but believe us - it's not!


# Context

At JLL, we have Research Analysts who take raw property data (which mimics data provided for the hackathon) and analyze this data to create a property narrative (putting numbers and data points into words/story).  JLL representatives use this narrative to quickly become knowledgeable about any property as a part of preparation to lead important conversations about the property.

*As you can imagine, creating these Research Analyst summaries can be very time intensive!*


## Challenge

**As a part of the Dare Mighty Things Hackathon, you are tasked with using the provided raw datasets and writing the logic to automate the creation of the Research Analyst's property narratives.**

Inputs available to you are included in the GitHub repo: mocked up data on Properties, Availabilities, Leases, and Sales.  Also included is a simplified entity relationship diagram and a glossary of terms that can be used to decipher the meaning of included data elements.


## Guidance

Judging criteria includes value of the output to the end user, innovation in highlighting key attributes in the narratives, and the ability to interface with users providing a good experience.  

The sky's the limit in how you allow the user to interact with the solution and access the narrative(s).


**Bonus**
Use any 3rd party datasets (demographic/other) to provide additional background about the property in relation to the market it is in.  


## Sample Narrative
Keep in mind that this is just an example of a possible narrative.  As part of the Challenge, we hope you can find additional insights and useful information that you may want to include into your generated narratives.  Don't just try to fit info into the below template, be creative!  i.e. nearby properties, other facts as mentioned above using 3rd party datasets, etc...

*Aon Center is located at 200 E Randolph St, Chicago IL in the East Loop Submarket of the Chicago Market.  The property is a Class A office building, built in 1974, standing 83 stories tall with a total size of 2,689,814 SQ ft. The property most recently sold on 10/29/2015 for $XXX,000,000 from Piedmont Office Realty Trust to the current owner of 601 W Companies.  The property is leased by Telos Group and managed by JLL.  Aon Center is well occupied, at 96% with the five largest active tenants being Aon with XXX,000 SQ ft, KPMG with XXX,000 SQ ft, JLL with XXX,000 SQ ft, Integrys Energy Group with XXX,000 SQ ft and Edelman Public Relations with XXX,000 SQ ft.  The largest available spaces in the building are on the 69th floor with 34,129 SQ ft of contiguous space, 15th floor with 31,710 SQ ft and 16th floor with 31,710 SQ ft.  Asking rents are roughly $XX SQ ft full service gross.*


## RAW Data

This data is representative of the source data that Research Analysts use to create narratives.

 - [Property Data Samples](https://github.com/JLL-IT/dare-mighty-things/blob/master/Property%20Data%20Samples.xlsx)
 - [Availability Data Samples](https://github.com/JLL-IT/dare-mighty-things/blob/master/Availability%20Data%20Samples.xlsx)
 - [Lease Data Samples](https://github.com/JLL-IT/dare-mighty-things/blob/master/Lease%20Comp%20Samples.xlsx)
 - [Sales Data Samples](https://github.com/JLL-IT/dare-mighty-things/blob/master/Sales%20Comp%20Samples.xlsx)
 - [Data Dictionary](https://github.com/JLL-IT/dare-mighty-things/blob/master/Data%20Dictionary.pdf)


## Entity Relationships

The sample data relationships are very simple.  Everything is tied together by a "**PropertyID**".
